document.body.textContent 

( from general → specific ) : CHAIN RULE/hierarchy 

textContent is the function that controls what text is controlled in the document. 
Head is what is behind the screen, and body is what the user sees. 
Everything that happens in a console is temporary.
document.GetElementById(“outcome”).textContent = “testest” 
document.GetElementById(“retrieving factor”).textContent = “what you want to replace this portion with”; → gets a result for a specific part of the webpage. 
Case sensitive! 
console.log (     document.GetElementById(“outcome”)   );
The HTML downloads first → then the javascript file. The javascript file overrides the HTML. 
HTML is the “platform” that the javascript runs from. 
Strings
console.log functions: 
Strings are used for numbers as well (not just letters) and can be used when numbers don’t change. 
Conditional statements
Consider all the possible outcomes.
