# my-cool-project

My first repository on GitHub

I love pretzels :cookie:, matcha powder :tea:, and college acceptance letters :computer:. 

- Notes for my-cool-project 5/7/18

**1. inputs:** 

- The amount of time a user wishes to use the timer for - ex. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours. 
  - 
- The type of music a user wishes to listen to 
  - White noise/classical/jazz/none
  - Where would I get this information from?
- The type of backdrop a user would like to see
  - Blank screen (can choose color)/forest/beach
- 
  
**2. outputs:**

*note to self: obtain a minimalistic approach*
- The user would see their choice of backdrop picture on their screen.
- The time remaining will remain small (so it does not distract the user), and at the center-bottom of the page. 
- There will be the user's music of choice playing in the background. If the user wishes to stop playing music, there will be a button for stop/play in the center-bottom. 
- There will be a stop button in the middle of the page that the user can press if they need to stop the Pomodoro timer. 
- No hour signs, just minute signs?

**3. variables** 

**4. data types**

- boolean: starting the simulation - true, stopping the simulation - false // playing music - true, not playing music - false // displaying a backdrop - true, not displaying a backdrop - false
- numbers: the 15, 30, 1 hour, etc signs // 
- strings: when a user wants to work for more than 2 hours, they can set a custom timer 
- if/then statements: if a user studies for 25 minutes, then set a 5 minute timer for their break.
